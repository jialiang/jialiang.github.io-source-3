## Background

The "[Matrix Digital Rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain)" refers to the iconic falling green code sequence featured in the opening of the Matrix series.

Here is a video clip from one of the movies showing the Matrix Digital Rain: [Download MKV File](https://rawcdn.githack.com/jialiang/huge-assets/5c89a3e05a61a01794c8072ef89592ad7bb11214/matrix/intro.mkv) (4.8MB).

## Motivation

Lots of people already attempted to reproduce the Matrix Digital Rain in code, but I found their results to be noticably different to the real thing and unsatisfying. So I decided to take a stab at it to see what the challenges are.

## Observations

Looking at the video clip above, here are some of my observations on what's going on:

- The code is katakana, numbers and some symbols inverted on the Y axis.
- The code doesn't actually move but continuously appended at the bottom.
- At the end of the trail, the code fades out.
- There seem to be some sort of motion blur on the code fading out.
- There can be more than 1 stream of code per column.
- Each frame, some of the characters change but most remain the same.
- The glow is not constant but pulsates.
- The glow is independent of the characters.
- The light of the glow bleeds into nearby code.

## Conclusion

Looking at my list of observations, it's no wonder that making a convincing replica in code is difficult.

After spending a lazy weekend fiddling around, I would say for most practical purposes, it is better to just take the idea of the digital rain and make it beautiful rather than try to mimic it faithfully.
