## Intro

This is the 3rd iteration of my personal website as part of my yearly website refresh.
This time around, the design is inspired by:

- The opening of the 3rd arc of the Owarimonogatari tv series.
- The [opening of the 1st Persona 2 game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-KjFyhWQs8).
- The UI of the Persona 5 game.
- [The Cowardly Witch's website](https://yui540.graphics/).

## Tech Stack

[EJS](https://ejs.co/) & [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is used for layout & content.
Sass is used for styling.

JavaScript libraries powered by [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) are used to compile source code & optimize assets.
[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is used to manage the aforementioned build process.

## Performance

The entire website inclusive of all resources for a 1080p screen has a transfer size of only 442kB, of which:

Type   | Approx. Size
:---   | ---:
JPG    | 292kB (66%)
SVG    | 84kB (19%)
WOFF2  | 32kB (7%)
PNG    | 22kB (5%)
CSS    | 7kB (2%)
HTML   | 4kB (1%)
JS     | 148 Bytes

For comparison, the [Google homepage](https://www.google.com/) trasfers a total of 390kB on the same device.


During rendering performance testing, the website is able to both play animations & scroll smoothly on an 2016 Asus Zenfone 3 & 2015 Macbook Pro.
